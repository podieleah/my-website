                        <h3>My Journey from SRE to Platform Engineering</h3>
                        <p class="lead">Passionate about building systems that empower developers and scale with business growth.</p>
                        
                        <p>As a Site Reliability Engineer, I've spent years ensuring systems stay up, incidents get resolved quickly, and teams learn from failures. But I've always been drawn to the proactive side of the equation - building the tools, processes, and infrastructure that prevent problems before they happen.</p>
                        
                        <p>That's what led me to platform engineering. It's the perfect blend of my SRE experience with a focus on developer experience and productivity. Instead of just keeping the lights on, I'm building the switches that make it easy for developers to control those lights themselves.</p>
                        
                        <h4 class="mt-4">What Drives Me</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Developer Experience:</strong> Creating tools and platforms that make developers' lives easier</li>
                            <li><strong>Automation:</strong> If it can be automated, it should be automated</li>
                            <li><strong>Scalability:</strong> Building systems that grow with the organization</li>
                            <li><strong>Reliability:</strong> Bringing SRE principles to platform design</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h4 class="mt-4">My Approach</h4>
                        <p>I believe the best platforms are invisible to their users. Developers shouldn't have to think about infrastructure - they should be able to focus on building great products. My goal is to create self-service platforms that are so intuitive and reliable that teams barely notice they're there.</p>
                        
                        <p>This portfolio site is a small example of that philosophy in action. It's built with infrastructure as code, automated deployment, proper monitoring, and documentation - all the things that would scale if this were a production platform serving multiple teams.</p>

                    <div class="card-body">
                        <p>The transition from SRE to platform engineering feels natural because both roles are fundamentally about enabling others to do their best work. In SRE, I enabled service teams to build reliable systems. In platform engineering, I'm enabling development teams to ship code faster and more confidently.</p>
                        
                        <p>The skills translate beautifully - understanding system reliability, automation, monitoring, and incident response are all crucial for building platforms that development teams can depend on.</p>
                        
                        <p>What excites me most is the opportunity to shape how entire organizations approach software delivery. A good platform can transform how teams work, making them more productive, more confident, and more focused on what they do best.</p>
