        <p class="hero-description">
            Hi! I'm a former emergency services professional who pivoted to tech in 2023.
            Since then, I've grown from Graduate to Mid-Level Site Reliability Engineer - delivering AWS cost optimisations, enterprise-grade monitoring, and resilient infrastructure solutions.
            I thrive by diving in, breaking things (constructively!), and building smarter systems as I go. 
            Now, I'm actively pursuing Platform Engineer roles where I can focus on infrastructure automation, developer enablement, and cloud security at scale.
            Curious about the projects behind this site - or my unconventional journey? Get in touch.

                    This portfolio project demonstrates my platform engineering capabilities and technical growth. 
                    Built to showcase the skills I've developed since transitioning into tech - from infrastructure 
                    as code and containerization to CI/CD pipelines and automated deployment on AWS. A practical 
                    example of the platforms I can build in my next role.
